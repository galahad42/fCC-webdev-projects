                    <p>Matthew Michael "Matt" Murdock is a lawyer who was blinded as a young boy by a radioactive substance that fell into his eyes from a crashed vehicle. Even though he lost his sight, his other four remaining senses were heightened to superhuman levels. <br>
                        After mobsters killed his father, Murdock was trained by Stick to become a warrior, using his disability as an advantage to fight for the Chaste. However, Murdock's compassion for Elektra led him to be rejected by Stick. <br>
                        He then returned to Columbia University with Foggy Nelson to gain his law degree. Murdock dedicated his life to fighting injustice where he could find it in New York City; by day, as a lawyer with his law firm Nelson and Murdock, and by night, as a vigilante known as the Masked Man.<br>
                        Murdock's actions as a crime fighter had eventually put him into conflict with a crime lord named Wilson Fisk. Murdock used his skills to expose Fisk's criminal activities and then have him arrested with Murdock now being known as Daredevil.</p>
